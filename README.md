# ISM6218-Advanced-Database-Management
Group project for ISM6218 Advanced Database Management

</br> Tools used: **SQL Developer, Excel, Powe BI**

*Project:* 
The project project started with the team members searching for the right dataset for various open data sites, like kaggle, data world etc.

On finding the appropriate data set we decided to create a web-based application which covers the essential aspects of management and operations of the dental clinic.

This database system facilitates the retrieval of information and generates medical report for the patients and dentists to refer in the future.It also manages reports and records of patient treatments which can be manipulated by the doctors and the clinic staff. The system also enables the patuents to schedule or cancel appointments.

Once the topic and data set was ready we further started discussing and evaluating the problem statement and the queries that can be executed using the dataset.

We also created interfact mock ups to showcase how our website will look like and used Power BI as a visualization tool to show different aspects of out data

*Assignment:*
The professor designed assignments to give us a breif overview of all concepts of SQL which were also submitted in groups
